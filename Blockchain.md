# Blockchain
## Data Structure & Time/Space complexity

For the blockchain, I used a linked list, where a node represents a block of the blockchain, the required data is added as the node attributes 

For the time complexity on a linked list the search is O(n) time, n = number of blocks, and for the insert is O(1) using a tail reference on the blockchain class

The space complexity is O(n), n = number of blocks
